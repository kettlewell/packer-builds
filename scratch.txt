To integrate the amazon import process directly into Packer, you can 
use a post-processor of type amazon-import, like so:


  "post-processors": [
   {
      "type": "amazon-import",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "s3_bucket_name": "my-bucket-name",
      "tags": {
        "Description": "packer amazon-import {{timestamp}}"
      }
    }
  ]


I may use this again, instead of using a shell script.... it does mean that you have to rebuild the entire thing from scratch,
and not as flexible as what a shell script can be, but there is a lot of simplicity here that can't be underestimated.
