Should really consider creating a minimal, bare-bones image as an AMI, 
and then use packers 'amazon-ebs' builder to configure and provision new images ...

           "scripts": [
               "scripts/console.sh",
               "scripts/disable-rhgb.sh",
               "scripts/yum_installs.sh",
               "scripts/pip_installs.sh",
               "scripts/ansible.sh",
               "scripts/ansible-deploys.sh",
               "scripts/ansible-profile.sh",
               "scripts/term-profile.sh",
               "scripts/rhel-bug-1212883.sh",
               "scripts/dracut-growpart.sh",
               "scripts/cloud-init.sh",
               "scripts/avahi-daemon.sh",
               "scripts/kdump.sh",
               "scripts/lock-root.sh",
               "scripts/cleanup.sh"
           ]

Still need to verify that the ansible deploy depot is uploaded and usable, as well as any AWS security roles that need to be applied

To integrate the amazon import process directly into Packer, you can 
use a post-processor of type amazon-import, like so:


  "post-processors": [
   {
      "type": "amazon-import",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "s3_bucket_name": "my-bucket-name",
      "tags": {
        "Description": "packer amazon-import {{timestamp}}"
      }
    }
  ]


I may use this again, instead of using a shell script.... it does mean that you have to rebuild the entire thing from scratch,
and not as flexible as what a shell script can be, but there is a lot of simplicity here that can't be underestimated.
